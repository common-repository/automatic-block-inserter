### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configuring block position

Once you've created the content for your block, you‚Äôll see a control in the sidebar named **"Position"**. Let's configure our block to be displayed after the post content.

üí° You can also display the block based on other block types. Here's a quick video showing how to configure your block to display after the **1st** core image block on the post.

## üõ†Ô∏è Position control overview 

Here's a quick overview that will help you understand how the positions control works:

1.   **Post Type**: Choose the type of content you want your block to be associated with (e.g., posts, pages).
2.   **Location Type**: Select whether your block should be placed in a specific "post area" or next to a "block type."
3.   **Position**: If you chose "post area," your block could be set to appear within the "post content." For "block type," you‚Äôll get a search-able dropdown menu listing all the available blocks where you can add your new block.
4.   **Location**: Decide if your block should appear **before** or **after** the selected position.
5.   **Offset**: This option is available when you select "**block type**" as your location type. It allows you to specify how many blocks away your new block should be placed from the chosen anchor block.
